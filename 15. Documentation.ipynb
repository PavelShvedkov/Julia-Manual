    "As in the example above, we recommend following some simple conventions when writing documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Always show the signature of a function at the top of the documentation, with a four-space indent so that it is printed as Julia code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be identical to the signature present in the Julia code (like mean(x::AbstractArray)), or a simplified form. Optional arguments should be represented with their default values (i.e. f(x, y=1)) when possible, following the actual Julia syntax. Optional arguments which do not have a default value should be put in brackets (i.e. f(x\\[, y\\]) and f(x\\[, y\\[, z\\]\\])). An alternative solution is to use several lines: one without optional arguments, the other(s) with them. This solution can also be used to document several related methods of a given function. When a function accepts many keyword arguments, only include a <keyword arguments> placeholder in the signature (i.e. f(x; <keyword arguments>)), and give the complete list under an # Arguments section (see point 4 below).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Include a single one-line sentence describing what the function does or what the object represents after the simplified signature block. If needed, provide more details in a second paragraph, after a blank line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-line sentence should use the imperative form (\"Do this\", \"Return that\") instead of the third person (do not write \"Returns the length...\") when documenting functions. It should end with a period. If the meaning of a function cannot be summarized easily, splitting it into separate composable parts could be beneficial (this should not be taken as an absolute requirement for every single case though).\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Do not repeat yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the function name is given by the signature, there is no need to start the documentation with \"The function bar...\": go straight to the point. Similarly, if the signature specifies the types of the arguments, mentioning them in the description is redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Only provide an argument list when really necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple functions, it is often clearer to mention the role of the arguments directly in the description of the function's purpose. An argument list would only repeat information already provided elsewhere. However, providing an argument list can be a good idea for complex functions with many arguments (in particular keyword arguments). In that case, insert it after the general description of the function, under an # Arguments header, with one - bullet for each argument. The list should mention the types and default values (if any) of the arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    # Arguments\n",

    "    - `dim::Integer=1`: the dimensions along which to perform the computation.\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Provide hints to related functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there are functions of related functionality. To increase discoverability please provide a short list of these in a See also: paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "    See also: [`bar!`](@ref), [`baz`](@ref), [`baaz`](@ref)\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Include any code examples in an # Examples section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples should, whenever possible, be written as doctests. A doctest is a fenced code block (see Code blocks) starting with ```jldoctest and contains any number of julia> prompts together with inputs and expected outputs that mimic the Julia REPL.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can then run make -C doc doctest=true to run all the doctests in the Julia Manual and API documentation, which will ensure that your example works.\n",
    "\n",
    "To indicate that the output result is truncated, you may write \\[...\\] at the line where checking should stop. This is useful to hide a stacktrace (which contains non-permanent references to lines of julia code) when the doctest shows that an exception is thrown, for example:\n",

    "Examples that are untestable should be written within fenced code blocks starting with ```julia so that they are highlighted correctly in the generated documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. Use backticks to identify code and equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia identifiers and code excerpts should always appear between backticks ` to enable highlighting. Equations in the LaTeX syntax can be inserted between double backticks ``. Use Unicode characters rather than their LaTeX escape sequence, i.e. ``α = 1`` rather than ``\\\\alpha = 1``.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    8. Place the starting and ending \"\"\" characters on lines by themselves.\n",
    "\n",

    "    ...\"\"\"\n",

    "This makes it clearer where docstrings start and end.\n",
    "\n",
    "    9. Respect the line length limit used in the surrounding code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings are edited using the same tools as code. Therefore, the same conventions should apply. It is recommended that lines are at most 92 characters wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "    10. Provide information allowing custom types to implement the function in an # Implementation section. These implementation details are intended for developers rather than users, explaining e.g. which functions should be overridden and which functions automatically use appropriate fallbacks. Such details are best kept separate from the main description of the function's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    11. For long docstrings, consider splitting the documentation with an # Extended help header. The typical help-mode will show only the material above the header; you can access the full help by adding a '?' at the beginning of the expression (i.e., \"??foo\" rather than \"?foo\").    "
