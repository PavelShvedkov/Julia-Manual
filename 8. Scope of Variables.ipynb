    "The scope of a variable is the region of code within which a variable is visible. Variable scoping helps avoid variable naming conflicts. The concept is intuitive: two functions can both have arguments called x without the two x's referring to the same thing. Similarly, there are many other cases where different blocks of code can use the same name without referring to the same thing. The rules for when the same variable name does or doesn't refer to the same thing are called scope rules; this section spells them out in detail.\n",

    "Certain constructs in the language introduce scope blocks, which are regions of code that are eligible to be the scope of some set of variables. The scope of a variable cannot be an arbitrary set of source lines; instead, it will always line up with one of these blocks. There are two main types of scopes in Julia, global scope and local scope. The latter can be nested. There is also a distinction in Julia between constructs which introduce a \"hard scope\" and those which only introduce a \"soft scope\", which affects whether shadowing a global variable by the same name is allowed or not."

    "A new local scope is introduced by most code blocks (see above table for a complete list). Some programming languages require explicitly declaring new variables before using them. Explicit declaration works in Julia too: in any local scope, writing local x declares a new local variable in that scope, regardless of whether there is already a variable named x in an outer scope or not. Declaring each new local like this is somewhat verbose and tedious, however, so Julia, like many other languages, considers assignment to a new variable in a local scope to implicitly declare that variable as a new local. Mostly this is pretty intuitive, but as with many things that behave intuitively, the details are more subtle than one might naïvely imagine.\n",

    "    2. Hard scope: If x is not already a local variable and assignment occurs inside of any hard scope construct (i.e. within a let block, function or macro body, comprehension, or generator), a new local named x is created in the scope of the assignment;\n",
    "    3. Soft scope: If x is not already a local variable and all of the scope constructs containing the assignment are soft scopes (loops, try/catch blocks, or struct blocks), the behavior depends on whether the global variable x is defined:\n",
    "    - if global x is undefined, a new local named x is created in the scope of the assignment;\n",
    "    - if global x is defined, the assignment is considered ambiguous:\n",
    "        - in non-interactive contexts (files, eval), an ambiguity warning is printed and a new local is created;\n",
    "        - in interactive contexts (REPL, notebooks), the global variable x is assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may note that in non-interactive contexts the hard and soft scope behaviors are identical except that a warning is printed when an implicitly local variable (i.e. not declared with local x) shadows a global. In interactive contexts, the rules follow a more complex heuristic for the sake of convenience. This is covered in depth in examples that follow.\n",

One might imagine that the s on the first line of the loop could be global while the s on the second line of the loop is local, but that's not possible since the two lines are in the same scope block and each variable can only mean one thing in a given scope."

    "We have now covered all the local scope rules, but before wrapping up this section, perhaps a few words should be said about why the ambiguous soft scope case is handled differently in interactive and non-interactive contexts. There are two obvious questions one could ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Why doesn't it just work like the REPL everywhere?\n",
    "    - Why doesn't it just work like in files everywhere? And maybe skip the warning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia ≤ 0.6, all global scopes did work like the current REPL: when x = <value> occurred in a loop (or try/catch, or struct body) but outside of a function body (or let block or comprehension), it was decided based on whether a global named x was defined or not whether x should be local to the loop. This behavior has the advantage of being intuitive and convenient since it approximates the behavior inside of a function body as closely as possible. In particular, it makes it easy to move code back and forth between a function body and the REPL when trying to debug the behavior of a function. However, it has some downsides. First, it's quite a complex behavior: many people over the years were confused about this behavior and complained that it was complicated and hard both to explain and understand. Fair point. Second, and arguably worse, is that it's bad for programming \"at scale.\" When you see a small piece of code in one place like this, it's quite clear what's going on:\n",
    "\n",
    "    s = 0\n",
    "    for i = 1:10\n",
    "        s += i\n",
    "    end\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously the intention is to modify the existing global variable s. What else could it mean? However, not all real world code is so short or so clear. We found that code like the following often occurs in the wild:\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = 123\n",
    "\n",
    "    # much later\n",
    "    # maybe in a different file\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i = 1:10\n",
    "        x = \"hello\"\n",
    "        println(x)\n",
    "    end\n",
    "\n",
    "    # much later\n",
    "    # maybe in yet another file\n",
    "    # or maybe back in the first one where `x = 123`\n",
    "\n",
    "    y = x + 234\n",
    "\n",
    "It's far less clear what should happen here. Since x + \"hello\" is a method error, it seems probable that the intention is for x to be local to the for loop. But runtime values and what methods happen to exist cannot be used to determine the scopes of variables. With the Julia ≤ 0.6 behavior, it's especially concerning that someone might have written the for loop first, had it working just fine, but later when someone else adds a new global far away—possibly in a different file—the code suddenly changes meaning and either breaks noisily or, worse still, silently does the wrong thing. This kind of \"spooky action at a distance\" is something that good programming language designs should prevent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in Julia 1.0, we simplified the rules for scope: in any local scope, assignment to a name that wasn't already a local variable created a new local variable. This eliminated the notion of soft scope entirely as well as removing the potential for spooky action. We uncovered and fixed a significant number of bugs due to the removal of soft scope, vindicating the choice to get rid of it. And there was much rejoicing! Well, no, not really. Because some people were angry that they now had to write:\n",
    "\n",
    "    s = 0\n",
    "    for i = 1:10\n",
    "        global s += i\n",
    "    end\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you see that global annotation in there? Hideous. Obviously this situation could not be tolerated. But seriously, there are two main issues with requiring global for this kind of top-level code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's no longer convenient to copy and paste the code from inside a function body into the REPL to debug it—you have to add global annotations and then remove them again to go back;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beginners will write this kind of code without the global and have no idea why their code doesn't work—the error that they get is that s is undefined, which does not seem to enlighten anyone who happens to make this mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Julia 1.5, this code works without the global annotation in interactive contexts like the REPL or Jupyter notebooks (just like Julia 0.6) and in files and other non-interactive contexts, it prints this very direct warning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Assignment to s in soft scope is ambiguous because a global variable by the same name exists: s will be treated as a new local. Disambiguate by using local s to suppress this warning or global s to assign to the existing global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This addresses both issues while preserving the \"programming at scale\" benefits of the 1.0 behavior: global variables have no spooky effect on the meaning of code that may be far away; in the REPL copy-and-paste debugging works and beginners don't have any issues; any time someone either forgets a global annotation or accidentally shadows an existing global with a local in a soft scope, which would be confusing anyway, they get a nice clear warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important property of this design is that any code that executes in a file without a warning will behave the same way in a fresh REPL. And on the flip side, if you take a REPL session and save it to file, if it behaves differently than it did in the REPL, then you will get a warning."
