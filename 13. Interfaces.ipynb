    "A key part in defining an AbstractArray subtype is IndexStyle. Since indexing is such an important part of an array and often occurs in hot loops, it's important to make both indexing and indexed assignment as efficient as possible. Array data structures are typically defined in one of two ways: either it most efficiently accesses its elements using just one index (linear indexing) or it intrinsically accesses the elements with indices specified for every dimension. These two modalities are identified by Julia as IndexLinear() and IndexCartesian(). Converting a linear index to multiple indexing subscripts is typically very expensive, so this provides a traits-based mechanism to enable efficient generic code for all array types.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction determines which scalar indexing methods the type must define. IndexLinear() arrays are simple: just define getindex(A::ArrayType, i::Int). When the array is subsequently indexed with a multidimensional set of indices, the fallback getindex(A::AbstractArray, I...)() efficiently converts the indices into one linear index and then calls the above method. IndexCartesian() arrays, on the other hand, require methods to be defined for each supported dimensionality with ndims(A) Int indices. For example, SparseMatrixCSC from the SparseArrays standard library module, only supports two dimensions, so it just defines getindex(A::SparseMatrixCSC, i::Int, j::Int). The same holds for setindex!.\n",

  {
   "source": [
    "In general, a broadcast operation is represented by a lazy Broadcasted container that holds onto the function to be applied alongside its arguments. Those arguments may themselves be more nested Broadcasted containers, forming a large expression tree to be evaluated. A nested tree of Broadcasted containers is directly constructed by the implicit dot syntax; 5 .+ 2.*x is transiently represented by Broadcasted(+, 5, Broadcasted(*, 2, x)), for example. This is invisible to users as it is immediately realized through a call to copy, but it is this container that provides the basis for broadcast's extensibility for authors of custom types. The built-in broadcast machinery will then determine the result type and size based upon the arguments, allocate it, and then finally copy the realization of the Broadcasted object into it with a default copyto!(::AbstractArray, ::Broadcasted) method. The built-in fallback broadcast and broadcast! methods similarly construct a transient Broadcasted representation of the operation so they can follow the same codepath. This allows custom array implementations to provide their own copyto! specialization to customize and optimize broadcasting. This is again determined by the computed broadcast style. This is such an important part of the operation that it is stored as the first type parameter of the Broadcasted type, allowing for dispatch and specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some types, the machinery to \"fuse\" operations across nested levels of broadcasting is not available or could be done more efficiently incrementally. In such cases, you may need or want to evaluate x .* (x .+ 1) as if it had been written broadcast(*, x, broadcast(+, x, 1)), where the inner operation is evaluated before tackling the outer operation. This sort of eager operation is directly supported by a bit of indirection; instead of directly constructing Broadcasted objects, Julia lowers the fused expression x .* (x .+ 1) to Broadcast.broadcasted(*, x, Broadcast.broadcasted(+, x, 1)). Now, by default, broadcasted just calls the Broadcasted constructor to create the lazy representation of the fused expression tree, but you can choose to override it for a particular combination of function and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the builtin AbstractRange objects use this machinery to optimize pieces of broadcasted expressions that can be eagerly evaluated purely in terms of the start, step, and length (or stop) instead of computing every single element. Just like all the other machinery, broadcasted also computes and exposes the combined broadcast style of its arguments, so instead of specializing on broadcasted(f, args...), you can specialize on broadcasted(::DestStyle, f, args...) for any combination of style, function, and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following definition supports the negation of ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "    broadcasted(::DefaultArrayStyle{1}, ::typeof(-), r::OrdinalRange) = range(-first(r), step=-step(r), length=length(r))"
